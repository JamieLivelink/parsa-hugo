If you've just been given a home improvement grant or are perhaps about to get started on the dream home improvement you've spent lockdown planning this may be the article you didn't know you needed.

You've no doubt put lots of effort into planning everything so far but have you thought about how you're going to remember this journey? don't worry if not we've got the following tips for you.

#### Writing a blog

Blogs are a great way to record life events such as this, you can update daily with photos and write short comments giving you a series of steps you can look back on. Friends and family can even check in and see how things are going whenever they like and can even leave you a comment celebrating your achievements in real time.

[Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/about/) is provided by Google and free to use so even those working on a limited budget can do it.

#### Creating a Photobook

This is a really effective way of recording daily progress, leaving you with a great memento to look back on in the future.

There are lots of solutions which make it easy to do and many are attached to high street names you'll already know such as [these available on ASDA Photo](https://www.asda-photo.co.uk/about/photobooks) which even lets you quickly add text descriptions describing the progress you've made in each photo.

Simply take a few photos and write down a couple of notes each day then upload them to the photo book builder, add the comments and order.

Shortly after you'll receive a high quality book through the door to keep and remember your journey.

#### Make a Photo Album on Facebook
